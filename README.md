## Notes

- same units everywhere (SOP SOP-051000) [vg/Î¼l]; excell [ml]
- look up tables: thinking in 'computer / programmer' way so that thinks could be indexed, automatically found (sample types, ...)
- CSV delimiter
- unify naming convention (lowercase/camelcase, separator, datetime format, ...)
